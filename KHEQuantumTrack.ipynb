    "Welcome to the Quantum track of KHE 2025! We are excited to welcome you into the quantum computing fray. Some of you may have extensive quantum experience; others will have next to none. Our objective for this challenge is to provide a challenging and exciting track for both veterans and novices alike. We want everyone to learn more about QC in the next 24 hours."

    "A basic version of this can be seen in Sherbrooke Universities \"Quantum Enigmas\", with the easiest example being the first enigma. The two door problem. Imagine you want up to two doors, each with someone, a \"guardian\", standing in front of the door, and one door has a prize behind it. You know that one of the guardians is always lying and one is always telling the truth. What question could you ask that gets the right answer every time?"

If that doesn't initially make sense, run through different scenarios in your head, what happens if the prize is behind the left door, and the guardian who lies is in front of it, what if that guardian is telling the truth? You should get the correct door to open every time."
